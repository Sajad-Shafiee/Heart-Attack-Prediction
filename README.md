# Heart Attack Prediction (Classification)

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using supervised machine learning classification techniques.

## Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that analyzes medical attributes of patients and predicts the risk of heart attack. The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset (`heart.csv`) contains medical and demographic features related to heart health.  
It is used for educational and learning purposes only.

## Methodology
The project includes the following steps:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature analysis
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using classification algorithms
5. Model evaluation and performance analysis
6. Prediction results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
